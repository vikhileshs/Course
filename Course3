Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.


Vikhilesh Sakhare 
Algorithm Analysis
Algorithm analysis is the systematic evaluation of computational complexity, focusing on time and space efficiency of algorithms. It involves studying how algorithms perform as input size grows using Big O notation to classify their behavior. This fundamental skill helps in choosing optimal solutions and understanding trade-offs between different algorithmic approaches.
